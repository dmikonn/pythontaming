## Disclaimer:
This is not a single consistent project.
This is the repository of different small scripts in Python either written by me from scratch to solve a task, or to illustrate some fun and curious way to apply the language.

## Licensing:
Feel free to use any part of this code, it's GPLv3.

## Table of contents:
Here is the list of scripts with a quick summary:

*00_renameByRegexp.py* is a renaming tool written for files in XenoGears Perfect Works translation archive (https://www.flickr.com/photos/29956195@N08/sets/72157616593453778/); to synchronize the filenames with the archive's torrent (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4772263/Xenogears_Perfect_Works_English_Translation_Ichiban_Manten_Systo). By the way, don't download it if you don't own the XenoGears artbook, because, you know, piracy ;). This one has a bit of sentimental value for me, because it was the very first practical application I've ever wrote.

*01_calcOneliner.py* is a simple one-line calculator in Python. Just run the script, write the expression and press Enter. The elegance.

*02_classPass.py* is a matryoshka-style coding puzzle about the value return. It's pretty straightforward to solve just by running, but could be an engaging mind game when one solves it in their head.

*03_evenOrOdd.py* is a beautiful example of string manipulation applied in a simple case of a even-odd telling apart script.
