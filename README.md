This is not a consistent project.
This is the repositiory of different small pythons scripts written by me now and then to learn something or to make my life easier, when I can. 

Feel free to use any part of this code, it's GPLv3.

Here is the list of scripts with a quick summary:

*authors_names_sorting.py* — a small sorting script for an array of names, the answer for a Python exersize published here: https://t.me/pythonist_ru/822

*filelisting.py* — a file listing script. It recursevely scans for every file in a folder here is placed and writes an output.txt file in form "[file extesion] | [filename (with extenison] | [full path to file]". That was part of a specific search and cataloguieng task with one very messy hard drive.

*filelist_to_ods.py* — an upgraded version of aforementioned script. It recursevely scans for every file in a folder here is placed and writes output to a your_file.ods file in columns "[type of file] | [file extesion] | [filename (with extenison] | [full path to file]". Uses pyecxecl-ods module, you can install it with `pip install pyexcel-ods`. 

*guessinggame.py* — the Guess-a-number game. Based on the one, presented in the Automate Boring Stuff with Python course, but enchanced to check important input and react more properly.

*rename_by_regexp.py* — the renaming tool written for files in XenoGears Perfect Works tranlation archive (https://www.flickr.com/photos/29956195@N08/sets/72157616593453778/); to syncronize the filenames with the archive's torrent (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4772263/Xenogears_Perfect_Works_English_Translation_Ichiban_Manten_Systo). By the way, don't download it if you don't own the XenoGears artbook, because, you know, piracy ;)
